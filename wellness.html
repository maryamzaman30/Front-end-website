<p>Eating <span>protein-rich</span> meals and snacks can benefit your health in many ways. 
  Protein reduces total calorie intake, supports a healthy body weight, and improves 
  body composition, bone health, and risk factors for heart disease. To boost your protein 
  intake while limiting your calorie intake, include protein sources at every meal and 
  snack and combine them with lower-calorie, <span>high-fiber foods</span>.</p>
  
<p>Many protein-rich products may be eaten on their own or combined with other nutritious 
  meals to make protein-packed snacks. <span>2% cottage cheese</span>, <span>turkey sticks
  </span>, <span>trail mix</span>, and <span>frozen Greek yogurt bark</span> are some nutritious, 
  high-protein snacks with fewer than 300 calories and at least 10 grams of protein per serving.</p>

<p>Cottage cheese is a filling, low-calorie snack with 23.5 grams of protein per cup and a high 
  concentration of vitamins and minerals. Turkey sticks are low in calories but high in protein, 
  making them an excellent choice for individuals wanting to cut calories. Trail mix is a popular 
  snack that may be produced at home or purchased ready-made. Greek yogurt may be made into 
  high-protein snacks that can be enjoyed at any time of day.</p>

  <h5 class="title-wellness">Health Benefits of Olive Oil</h5>
  <img src="Images/health3.webp" alt="Article 2">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Melissa Nieves, LND</p>
  <hr>
<p>Olive oil is a versatile fat that is created by crushing, milling, and pitting olives to obtain 
    their oil. This nutritious oil is rich in protective compounds that positively impact health in 
    several ways, including protecting against <span>heart disease</span> and <span>type 2 
    diabetes</span>. It is an important component of the <span>Mediterranean diet</span>, which is 
    considered one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world.</p>

<p>Olive oil enhances heart health by lowering the risk of heart disease by encouraging healthy 
    blood lipid levels, blood pressure, blood vessel function, and the prevention of 
    atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the thickening or hardening of arteries caused by plaque 
    formation. Olive oil-rich diets have been demonstrated to protect against heart disease risk 
    factors such as atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Olive oil contains compounds, including phenolic antioxidants, that decrease the production of 
    inflammatory molecules that promote atherosclerosis. For example, oleuropein is a phenolic 
    compound found in olive oil that helps reduce inflammation and inhibits the expression of 
    adhesion molecules, which play key roles in the development and progression of 
    atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>According to research, diets high in olive oil may help slow the progression of atherosclerosis. 
    Furthermore, ingesting olive oil on a daily basis may help reduce LDL cholesterol, boost levels 
    of heart-protective HDL cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, all of which may help prevent 
    heart disease.</p>

<p>Olive oil also has a lot of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These substances assist 
    to decrease inflammation and protect cells from harm. One of the key reasons that olive oil 
    consumption is related with lower illness risk is because it is high in these substances.</p>

<p>In conclusion, olive oil is a healthy fat with several health advantages. It improves heart 
    health, decreases inflammation, and includes protective compounds that benefit health in a 
    variety of ways. You may gain the various advantages of olive oil by include it in your 
    diet.</p>

  <h5 class="title-wellness">6 Ways to Increase Your Protein Intake</h5>
  <img src="Images/halal-healthy-way.blogspot.jpg" alt="Article 3">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Barnes, RDN</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Increasing your <span>protein intake</span> is essential for maintaining a <span>healthy 
    body</span>. Protein is crucial for tissue formation and repair, immune system support, 
    and energy production. Here are some suggestions to help you increase your protein intake:</p>

  <p>1. Make protein-rich foods a priority in your diet: Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, 
      dairy products, legumes, and nuts in your diet. These foods have a lot of protein.</p>

  <p>2. Start your day with protein: Include protein-rich meals like eggs, Greek yogurt, or a 
    protein smoothie in your breakfast. This will keep you fuller for longer and provide you 
    energy throughout the day.</p>

  <p>3. Snack wisely: Instead of sugary or processed food, choose protein-rich choices like 
    almonds, Greek yogurt, or protein bars. These will keep you full and help you avoid 
    overeating.</p>

  <p>4. Plan your meals as follows: Make your meals ahead of time and add a decent quantity of 
    protein in each one. This will guarantee that you achieve your daily protein needs while also 
    making better dietary choices.</p>

  <p>5. Consider protein supplements: If you find it difficult to satisfy your protein requirements 
    just via diet, protein supplements such as whey protein powder or protein bars might be a 
    practical option.</p>

  <p>6. Drink plenty of water: Water is essential for protein digestion and absorption. To support 
    your protein consumption, drink at least 8 glasses of water every day.</p>

  <p>Remember, before making any big dietary changes, it's crucial to speak with a medical expert 
    or certified dietician. They may provide you individualized guidance based on your unique 
    requirements and goals. The recommended daily protein intake varies depending on factors such as age, sex, 
    and physical activity level. Here you can calculate the protein needed based on your <span> weight
    below </span> </p>

  <h5 class="title-wellness">Is BMI an Accurate Predictor of Health?</h5>
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Allison Herries, RDN</p>
  <hr>
  <p>BMI is a <span>risk-prediction tool</span> that can help predict health risks. The four 
    specific BMI cut-off points were developed in the 20th century by the Metropolitan Life 
    Insurance Company, which used data to create height and weight tables. A statistical analysis 
    helped determine the risk factors included in its insurance plans. The company found that those 
    within their “ideal” weight for their body height and frame lived longer than those above their 
    “ideal” weight.</p>

  <p>These weight charts eventually transitioned to BMI because it correlates better with body fat 
    percentage and health outcomes than ideal body weight. The Centers for Disease Control and 
    Prevention (CDC) provides a BMI calculator and chart to see where your BMI lands within the 
    categories. <span>Calculate your BMI below</span></p>

  <p>“The best way to think about BMI is as a risk-prediction tool,” says Brad Dieter, PhD, an 
    exercise physiologist, molecular biologist, biostatistician, and senior advisory board member 
    for the National Academy of Sports Medicine. “The higher your BMI, the more at risk you are 
    for a poor health outcome.”</p>

    <img src="Images/patient.info.jpg" alt="BMI Ranges" class="bmi-chart-img-wellness">
  <p>However, BMI is <span>not a perfect</span> predictor of health and can be impacted by conditions 
    including pregnancy, having a lot of muscle mass, and getting older. According to research, 
    the BMI alone may not accurately characterize metabolic health, which is related to how much 
    body fat a person has. BMI might be a good place to start, but it's crucial to know its 
    limits.</p>

  <h5 class="title-wellness">Does Getting Wet From Rain Make You Sick?</h5>
  <img src="Images/health6.webp" alt="Article 5">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Farah Khan, MD</p>
  <hr>
  <p>It is a <span>common misconception</span> that getting wet in the rain can make you catch 
    a cold. The rain itself can't actually make you sick. However, staying wet and cold for 
    <span>prolonged periods</span> may cause you to lose enough body heat to negatively impact your 
    immune system, increasing your chance of contracting the cold or flu virus..</p>

  <p>VIRUSES ARE NOT TRANSMITTED BY RAIN. The bodily fluids of an infected individual can transmit 
    viruses that cause the common cold and flu. You can get infected by having close contact with 
    sick individuals, contacting a surface that has been exposed to the virus through snot or 
    saliva, and then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
  
  <p>During the cold and wet seasons, more people get sick, although this is probably because they 
    spend more time indoors. According to research, cold, dry environments are more likely to favor 
    the growth of cold and flu viruses. When it rains or is humid outside, these viruses are less 
    likely to spread. However, individuals are more prone to gather indoors on rainy days. 
    Indirectly, wet weather may increase the likelihood that viruses may infect more people who 
    are in close proximity.</p>
  
  <p>While you can't catch a cold in the rain, you may catch a chill that lowers your body 
    temperature and weakens your immune system. GIn cool weather, remaining and becoming wet might 
    make it difficult to control your body's temperature. This is due to the fact that as 
    perspiration or rain repeatedly evaporates from the skin, the body loses heat as a result. 
    Research has found that drops in body temperature can decrease people's immune response, 
    which helps them fight off viruses. As a result, if you feel chilly during or after being in 
    the rain, you might be more likely to contract a virus.</p>
  
  <p>Showering won't make you sick either because it's not the rainfall that causes sickness in 
    some people. It's doubtful that taking a shower will cause your body temperature to drop 
    sufficiently to weaken your immune system. In a temperature-controlled space, you normally 
    dry off and put on dry clothing after taking a shower. Your body does not lose much heat as a 
    result of trying to drain additional water from your skin even after a brief, chilly shower. 
    Hypothermia, or unusually low body temperature, can result from being outside in cold weather, 
    whether it's raining or not.

  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Barbie Cervoni, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Setting reasonable and attainable workout goals is essential for staying motivated and tracking 
    progress. Personal trainers recommend using the <span>SMART</span> method to create goals that 
    are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. 
    Here are 8 fitness goals recommended by personal trainers that you may want to consider:</p>

  <p>1. Work Out 12 Days in a Month: Building workout routines and seeing results need consistency. 
    Schedule your exercises ahead of time, create phone reminders, and discuss your goal with 
    a friend to keep you accountable.</p>
  
  <p>2. Run Continuously for 1 Mile in 6 Weeks: This goal is ideal for anyone who hasn't exercised 
    in a long time and wants to improve their cardiovascular health.</p>
  
  <p>3. Do 15-Minute Stretches After a Workout: Stretching can aid with flexibility, muscular pain, 
    and injury prevention.</p>
  
  <p>4. Rest for 8 Full Days Monthly: It's crucial to take rest days so that your body can heal 
    and re-build muscular tissue.</p>
  
  <p>5. Increase Your Water Intake: Staying hydrated is beneficial to general health and can aid in 
    workout performance.</p>
  
  <p>6. Improve Your Sleep Quality: A good night's sleep is essential for muscle healing, hormone 
    control, and general wellness.</p>
  
  <p>7. Try a New Workout Class or Activity: Trying new things may keep your exercises interesting 
    and challenging.</p>
        
  <p>8. Walk or Bike to Work at Least Once a Week: Physical activities can help you enhance your 
    overall fitness by including it into your everyday routine.</p>

<div class="article-wellness" id="perfectionism">
  <h5 class="title-wellness">Perfectionism and Anxiety: The Problem With Trying to Be Perfect</h5>
  <img src="Images/health9.webp" alt="Article 7">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Michael MacIntyre, MD</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The pursuit of flawlessness, or perfectionism, may be harmful to both your physical 
    and emotional health. According to research, perfectionism may make people more stressed 
    out, anxious, depressed, and even suffer from medical diseases.</p>

  <p>The constant pursuit of <span>perfection</span> can lead to chronic stress, as 
    individuals set unrealistic standards for themselves and fear failure or criticism.
      This heightened stress can have negative consequences on both mental and physical 
      well-being, impacting sleep quality, immune function, and overall health.</p>
  
  <p>Perfectionism is also closely linked to <span>anxiety disorders</span>, with perfectionistic 
    tendencies often exacerbating anxiety symptoms. The fear of making mistakes or falling short 
    of expectations can create a constant state of worry and unease.</p>
  
  <p><span>Depression</span> is another potential outcome of perfectionism. Impossibly high 
    expectations can put pressure on people to feel inadequate and critical of themselves, 
    which can increase or cause the onset of depression symptoms.</p>
  
  <p>Moreover, perfectionism can manifest in physical health issues such as chronic headaches, 
    digestive problems, and even cardiovascular conditions. The body might suffer as a result 
    of ongoing stress and strain, which can result in a number of health issues.</p>
  
  <p>For wellbeing to endure, perfectionism's detrimental effects must be understood. To escape 
    the cycle of perfectionism and put your emotional and physical health first, you must own your 
    shortcomings, establish reasonable objectives, and practice self-compassion.</p>

  <h5 class="title-wellness">Managing Anxiety With the "Rule of Three"</h5>
  <img src="Images/health10.webp" alt="Article 8">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; By Medically reviewed by Michael MacIntyre, MD</p>
  <hr>
  
  <p>A therapist advised using the <span>Rule of Three</span> as an anxiety management technique. 
    It involves limiting the amount of time you spend worrying to three things at once. You 
    picture a tree with three branches, each one holding worry. No further worries are 
    permitted to into your mind after the tree is completely full. This tactic may seem easy, 
    yet it may be really effective in eradicating anxious thoughts. By reducing the number of 
    things you worry about, you can focus your attention on identifying solutions and taking 
    action, rather than being paralyzed by fear.</p>

<h5 class="title-wellness">Can Coffee Make You Anxious?</h5>
 <img src="Images/health11.webp" alt="Article 9">
  <p class="authenticity-check-wellness">&#9989; Medically reviewed by Allison Herries, RDN</p>
  <hr>
  <p><span>Caffeine</span> can increase <span>anxiety</span> in some people. Caffeine is a powerful 
    stimulant that can speed up bodily functions and mimic the sensations of anxiety. This can make 
    it difficult for the mind to distinguish between the effects of caffeine and actual anxiety. 
    Anxiety brought on by coffee is frequently accompanied by symptoms including restlessness, 
    jitteriness, headaches, sweating, and sleeplessness. For those who are sensitive to caffeine, 
    consuming more than 400 mg of it daily (about four to five cups of coffee) may make anxiety and 
    panic episodes more likely.</p>

  <p>Due to hereditary variables, everyone's response to caffeine varies. Some individuals may be 
    more susceptible to its effects and metabolize it more slowly, resulting in it being in the body 
    for a longer period of time. For people who are prone to anxiety, regularly using caffeine can 
    lead to a vicious cycle in which they drink coffee to battle the low energy brought on by 
    caffeine-induced sleeplessness but end up feeling even more anxious as a result.</p>
  
  <p>If you're concerned that caffeine may be playing a role in your anxiety, you can try keeping a 
    journal to track your caffeine intake and its effects on your mood. This might assist you in 
    figuring out whether there is a link between your coffee intake and your anxiety levels.</p>

  Design: This design is similar to news page but what mainly makes the 2 distinct is that
  this wellness page has tools like calculators, journals, etc.
  Resources used:
 -Note: source for any file like image is also mentioned in their file name, 
  for example image named health1.webp is an image taken from health.com.
  And if there is a number written in a file name, it means more images are
  taken from that site and health1.webp is the first one.
 -Note: Articles are written in a shorter way and some words are also rephrased
