      <p class= "p-news">Despite popular TikTok videos showing the advantages of magnesium supplements, experts 
        advise reading up on them and talking to a doctor before using them. Magnesium is necessary 
        for the health of muscles and nerves, although it's ideal to obtain it through dietary sources 
        first. More study is required, although supplements may aid with blood pressure reduction, 
        migraine relief, and muscular cramping. Blood tests are not always reliable for detecting 
        magnesium insufficiency, thus the best test is diet. Beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and 
        leafy greens are some examples of foods high in magnesium. While different kinds of magnesium 
        supplements offer various advantages, it's crucial to stick to the daily dosage. Before using 
        supplements, it is recommended to speak with a doctor because they may interfere with other 
        prescriptions. It's crucial to purchase from reliable sources, and supplements ought to have 
        correct labels. Overall, magnesium supplements can be helpful, but it's crucial to keep an 
        eye on their results.</p>

      <img src="Images/clevelandclinic.jpg" alt="Article 2" class= "article-image-news">
      <p class= "p-news">It is advised to concentrate on the timing and quality of snacks in order to snack for 
        improved blood sugar regulation and general wellness. Pick nutritious snacks including whole 
        grains, protein, and healthy fats from top brands. Apples with almond or peanut butter, grapes 
        or other fruit with cheese and almonds, pretzel chips or whole grain crackers with carrots and 
        hummus are a few ideas. It's also crucial to consider when you eat your snacks. Avoid snacking 
        after 9 o'clock at night because it has been shown that it raises triglyceride and blood sugar 
        levels. Instead, choose to have wholesome snacks early in the day. Follow your doctor's advice 
        on snack time if you have a medical condition that calls for more frequent eating, though.</p>

    <div class="article-news" id="raw-milk">
      <h5 class="title-news">The popularity of raw milk is rising, but is it safe to consume?</h5>
      <p class="p-news">Raw milk is milk that has not gone through the pasteurization process. The sale and consumption 
       of raw milk is debatable; some governments allow it, while others continue to impose restrictions. 
       It is crucial to remember that raw milk involves more safety hazards than pasteurized milk, 
       principally because ingesting raw dairy products increases the chance of contracting a food-borne 
       disease. Consuming raw milk is not recommended, according to experts, as it can cause serious 
       ailments including food poisoning.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">Milk is heated during the pasteurization process to eradicate dangerous germs, making it safe 
      for ingestion. The nutritional content of milk is not significantly affected by pasteurization, 
      even if it could cause a modest reduction in some vitamins. Pasteurized milk has advantages in 
      terms of safety that exceed any possible nutritional drawbacks.</p>
      <img src="Images/milkyday.jpg" alt="Article 3" class="article-image-news">
  
    <p class="p-news">Consuming raw milk can expose people to dangerous microorganisms including Salmonella, Brucella, 
      E. coli, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and E. coli, which can lead to food-borne diseases. 
      These diseases can cause everything from minor symptoms like diarrhoea and nausea to more serious 
      side effects like kidney or brain damage.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">Due to the safety issues involved, registered dietitians and nutrition specialists advise against 
      ingesting raw milk. Social media disinformation may have an impact on the popularity of raw milk, 
      therefore it's critical to rely on reliable, scientifically sound information when making judgments 
      regarding food safety.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">It is essential to take into account the possible hazards of consuming raw milk, especially for 
      vulnerable groups including kids, pregnant women, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems. 
      It is ultimately up to the customer to decide whether or not to ingest raw milk, keeping in mind 
      the accompanying safety hazards.</p>

      <h5 class="title-news">According to a study, older adults with vision impairments may be more likely to develop dementia.</h5>
      <p class="p-news">A new study has found a link between vision impairments and dementia risk in older adults. 
      While the study does not establish causation, previous research has shown that improving eye 
      health can lead to improved cognitive function. Therefore, the correlation between vision 
      impairments and dementia risk is worth considering.</p>
      <img src="Images/smartdraw.png" alt="Article 4" class="article-image-news">
  
     <p class="p-news">Experts advise people to emphasize routine eye care, especially if they have a family history of eye 
      problems or are over 65. To examine eye health and address any problems or symptoms connected to vision, 
      it is crucial to see a healthcare provider. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, those 
      over 65 should schedule routine eye checkups every one to two years.</p>
  
      <p class="p-news">Maintaining good eye health is essential since vision is a major component of memory and cognitive 
      function. It's crucial to pay attention to any changes in eyesight since eye conditions are frequently 
      curable. Additionally, talking about a family history of eye conditions and lifestyle choices that may 
      have an impact on eye health will assist medical experts in making the right suggestions and treatment 
      choices.</p>
  
      <p class="p-news">Overall, the connection between vision problems and the chance of developing dementia emphasizes the 
      significance of giving eye health first priority and getting frequent eye exams. People may be able to 
      lower their risk of dementia by taking care of any visual issues they may have and keeping their eyes 
      healthy.</p>

    <h5 class="title-news">What Does "Bed Rotting" Mean? The Latest Self-Care Trend among Gen Z, Explained</h5>
    <img src="Images/khaleejtimes.jpg" alt="Article 5" class="article-image-news">
    <p class="p-news"> A recent TikTok craze called "bed rotting" encourages people to spend long stretches of time 
      in bed doing nothing but passive things like eating food, watching TV, and scrolling through 
      gadgets. Most followers of this trend are members of Generation Z, who may be exhausted from 
      their commitments to job, education, their families, or social activities. While some people 
      may find short-term benefits from bed rotting, if it persists for more than a day or two, it 
      may be cause for concern. Self-care is crucial to managing stress and boosting vitality, 
      according to experts.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news"> Bed rotting can be a sign of depression or other mental health issues. If you discover that 
      you have been exhibiting this behavior for a long period of time, it's crucial to get treatment 
      from a mental health expert. Engaging in regular exercise, interacting with friends and family, 
      and practicing mindfulness are some good coping mechanisms for stress and burnout.</p>

      <h5 class="title-news">Could a Smartwatch Help Detect Parkinson's Disease Earlier?</h5>
      <img src="Images/michaeljfox.jpg" alt="Article 6" class="article-image-news">
    <p class="p-news"> A recent study found that smartwatches could offer useful information on Parkinson's disease 
      symptoms. This is so that smartwatches can monitor how rapidly a person moves, as slower motions 
      are frequently an early sign of Parkinson's disease. The earlier a person is identified with 
      Parkinson's, the more time there is to develop a treatment plan and get ready for the future, 
      according to experts.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">The study uses artificial intelligence to evaluate the data of 103,712 wearers of smartwatches 
      who recorded their activity rate throughout time periods of one week between 2013 and 2016. While 
      the study's lead author, Cynthia Sandor, PhD, an up-and-coming leader at the UK Dementia Research 
      Institute at Cardiff University, did anticipate spotting "subtle movement changes" in people before 
      Parkinson's disease was identified, she and her team did not anticipate observing a decline in 
      people's movement speeds that were comparable to those with Parkinson's.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">Data from smartwatches provided a partial bird's eye picture of how people's motions changed over 
      time and how that represented more significant changes in their general state of health. “We were 
      further surprised by seeing how well the models trained on smartwatch data performed even in the 
      general population including individuals diagnosed with other diseases,” Sandor said.</p>

      <h5 class="title-news">Most People Do not Know What a Healthy Blood Pressure Is.</h5>

    <p class="p-news">The majority of Americans are unaware of what a normal or healthy blood pressure measurement is, 
      according to a study that was written up in the journal Medical Decision Making. Blood pressure 
      levels less than 120/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) are considered normal or healthy. Although they 
      were confident in their understanding of blood pressure, the majority of Americans were unaware 
      of this.</p>
  
    <p class="p-news">Lead study author Wändi Bruine de Bruin, PhD, Provost Professor of Public Policy, Psychology, 
      and Behavioral Science at the University of Southern California, told Health that there is little 
      education about blood pressure in the doctor's office because visits often focus on other topics. 
      Only about a quarter of persons in the United States who have hypertension, or high blood pressure, 
      have it under control. Heart disease and stroke, the two major causes of mortality among Americans, 
      are made more likely by high blood pressure. </p>

    <p class="p-news"> A recent study found that sleep deprivation might work against exercise's beneficial benefits 
      on brain health. Although sleep and exercise have separate effects on brain health, if neither 
      are getting enough of either, their effects may cancel one other out. Experts advise progressively 
      modifying sleep and exercise routines to develop wholesome, enduring habits that support brain 
      health.</p> 
  
    <p class="p-news"> In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, over 9,000 persons between the ages of 50 and 95 
      were tracked for more than ten years. They discovered that those who engaged in more physical 
      activity and slept for six to eight hours every night had superior cognitive function as they 
      aged than individuals who exercised but didn't obtain at least six hours of sleep every night.</p>
