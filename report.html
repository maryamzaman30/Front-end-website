    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you 
       choose to implement?</p>
   <hr> 
   <p>The essential story being told by Health Today is that it is a reliable source of 
      health and wellness information. It strives to give useful information and resources 
      to assist people live healthier lives. The first page which is the index page showcases 
      its expertise and credibility through the data section, highlighting the years of 
      experience, the number of people reached annually, and the number of medical experts 
      involved. This establishes the website as a reliable source of information.</p>

    <p>In terms of structure, the layout of Health today is mostly straightforward and 
        clear. It follows a typical layout commonly found in health and wellness websites. 
        Health Today includes news and wellness articles on various subjects such as 
        exercise, food, diseases, anxiety, trends etc, which are common topics of interest 
        for individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Health Today incorporates rich media such as images, gifs, videos and 
        resources to make the content more engaging, appealing and useful. The use of 
        headings and subheadings helps organize the information and make it easily scannable 
        for visitors looking for specific topics.</p>

        valuable health and wellness information. It presents the information in a clear and

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, 
       websites, artists, blogs).</p>
    <hr> 
    <p>1. <a href="https://www.health.com/" target="_blank">https://www.health.com/</a> 
       - This website is a heavy inspiration for Health Today. I have taken all the articles 
       which I wrote in my own words and most of the images from there. I was impressed by 
       the use of white space on health.com. I noticed how the website utilized ample white 
       space to create a clean and organized layout, allowing the content to breathe and 
       making it easier for users to focus on the information presented. This inspired me to 
       adopt a similar approach, ensuring that the design was not cluttered and overwhelming 
       for the users. I was inspired to create the same organized layout design for the 
       first (index) page.</p>

    <p>Another inspiration taken from health.com was the use of visually appealing and 
       high-quality images. This website made me understand the importance of engaging 
       visuals in capturing the attention of visitors and conveying the overall message 
       of the website. This website carefully selected relevant and captivating images to 
       accompany the content and enhance the user experience.</p>
    
    <p>2. <a href="https://www.noisli.com/" target="_blank">https://www.noisli.com/</a> and 
       <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/health" target="_blank">
        https://www.omnicalculator.com/health</a> - Websites like these inspired me to 
        create various tools like scenic sounds, health calculators etc.</p>
    
    <p>3. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/us</a> - This website is the inspiration behind my 
        website title name 'Health Today'. The title is simple and it conveys the message that 
        the website includes and talks about everything related to health, like news and other 
        various topics.</p>

    <div class="report-writing" id="accessibility">
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</p>
    <hr> 
    <p>1. Font size and Font weight - Font size of website's main text is increased and 
        set the most texts' font weight to bold or bolder. It is especially beneficial for 
        individuals with weak vision.</p>

    <p>2. Simple Language - People with cognitive disabilities, such as dyslexia or ADHD, 
        may find it difficult to process complex language. Using simple language can make 
        it easier for them to understand and engage with the content.</p>

    <p>3. Clickable links - When a person clicks on a link, it will smoothly scroll to a 
        specific section of the page, such as a news article that the link refers to. 
        Smooth scrolling to a specific section of a page when a link is clicked can make 
        it easier for people with disabilities to navigate the website. For people with 
        mobility impairments, who may have difficulty using a mouse or trackpad, this feature 
        allows them to quickly access the content they are interested in. For users with visual impairments, smooth scrolling can help them keep 
        track of their location on the page as they navigate, reducing confusion and 
        disorientation.</p>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>1. Website is responsive. It works on desktop, tablet, mobile and smaller mobile 
        screens.</p>

    <p>2. In mobile or smaller mobile view, the navigation bar is replaced by a burger menu, 
        Search bar and all the links are organised vertically inside a burger button.</p>

    <p>3. I have include Ai therapy (I did not wrote the code myself). Chatbots are available 
        round the clock, providing constant support to users. By including this on my 
        website, I can provide a convenient and accessible option for users seeking 
        mental health support.</p> 
    </div> <!-- End of <div class="report-writing" id="usability"> -->

    <div class="report-writing" id="learning">
    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve 
       that?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>1. I learned how to create a responsive design that works on most screens. I learned 
        this by using numerous resources, such as W3Schools website, sabe.io to understand 
        CSS properties and HTML. I achieved this by creating categories with specific 
        values and labelling them, for example, values from max-width 1292px to min-width 
        880px were labeled for tablet screens.</p>

    <p>2. I learned a lot whilst changing a little bit of all of the reused code such as AI 
        therapy, Mobile navbar and BMI calculator that belongs to other people. I learned a 
        little bit about how AI works, there are questions and responses. In BMI calculator 
        I added if and else statements and through BMI calculator, I was able to achieve and 
        write a Javascript code for Protein intake calculator by myself.</p>

    <p>3. Finally I learned how to create scenic sounds. While going through sabe.io and 
        W3Schools, I was able to achieve and write my own Javascript code.</p>

    <div class="report-writing" id="evaluation-i">
    <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
    <p>What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I am happy with how my website turned out. As a beginner in web development, I mostly 
        wrote or used code in a simple way. I implemented almost everything, from animation 
        to rich media to JavaScript, in a simple way. I also think the main colors that I 
        used on the background, navbar, and footer look great - colors like cyan, both in 
        darker and lighter shades.</p>

    <p>The code for the scenic sounds and protein intake calculator, which I wrote myself, 
        also turned out to be successful.</p>    
    </div> <!-- End of <div class="report-writing" id="evaluation-i"> -->

    <div class="report-writing" id="evaluation-ii">
    <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
    <p>What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently 
        another time?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Responsiveness and positioning of items could be improved. Making a website responsive 
        can be a complex process that requires careful planning and attention to detail. It 
        involves testing the website on a variety of screen sizes to ensure that it looks 
        and functions well on all of them. Implementing CSS on smaller screen sizes proved 
        to be challenging especially the positioning part because whenever it was displayed 
        on different screens, it would create a lot of white space. I might do this 
        differently next by learning and using CSS framework like Bootstrap. These frameworks 
        provide pre-built components and styles that can help create a responsive layout more 
        easily. They also include tools for managing the positioning of elements on different 
        screen sizes, which can help reduce the amount of white space and improve the overall 
        user experience.</p>
