## Web Development - Individual Project

## Jul 2023 - Sep 2023

## Associated with University of London

For my final project in the second semester, I created a five-page health-focused website in HTML, CSS and JS as part of an individual web project. The site featured the latest health news, articles, wellness tips, and basic AI therapy. I conducted research, created wireframes, designed sitemaps and mock-ups, and coded the website. I added interactive tools using JavaScript and ensured responsiveness with media queries, prioritizing accessibility and usability.
