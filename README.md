## Web Development - Individual Project

## Associated with University of London

For my final project in the 2nd semester, I designed and developed a five-page health-oriented website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, aimed at making wellness content more accessible and user-friendly. The platform provided health news, articles, wellness tips and a lightweight AI-based therapy feature, addressing the challenge of engaging users with trustworthy and digestible health information. I led the full development process, from research and wireframing to sitemap creation mock-ups and frontend coding, while integrating interactive tools and ensuring cross-device responsiveness using media queries. Throughout, I prioritized user accessibility and intuitive navigation.
